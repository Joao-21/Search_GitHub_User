# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Run this command to install all dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Definitions

I chose to create this app with create-react-app because I'm already more familiar with the tool. Along with that, I also opted for TypeScript for all the ease it offers when the application is being developed.

Even though it's a small application, I decided to use Redux as the application's state control. First, because it makes it easier to control the states, since it is global and the defined and updated states can be directly accessed from anywhere in the application. And second, I chose this path to certify that I have mastery of the tool.

Another path taken was the choice of using a css preprocessor, SCSS. It is the new version of SASS.

For the consumption of the API, I chose to use axios, very easy and fast to use.

The way I used the design I took inspiration from some google searches and existing projects, since I couldn't use any design library.
